    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <h2>Each link has a purpose...</h2>
    <h3>Landing page</h3>
        <p>Brews and Buds' beauty of a landing page also has brains.  Responsive Design CSS keeps it clear and aesthetically pleasing on devices of any size!  The design and creation of this website was logged using Git and Github, providing a chronology of changes and improvements made since its inception.</p>

    <h3>Breweries</h3>
        <p>We regret to inform you that you will not find hip new joints on this page. But with the aid of SQL, python, and its powerful libraries, we manipulated and cleaned up real life data into beautiful infographics for various fictional breweries.</p>
    
    <h3>Foliage</h3>
        <p>The journey into the jungle continues with python and pandas. Thanks to our back-end development, you can put in orders for the plants you fell in love with and want to bring home.  You can even buy one for a friend if it is in stock!</p>
    
    <h3>Blog</h3>
        <p>While not up and running yet, this blog page would allow breweries and patrons to give us feedback and thanks using either PHP or Ruby.</p>
    
    <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>This website wouldn't be complete without some proper javascript. Using the VUE.js framework, you will be able to ask us questions.  Using machine learning, we'll answer you immediately!</p>
    
    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Now that you have seen my professional work, let's get a bit more personal</p>
